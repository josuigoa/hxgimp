  "Gives an image a softglow effect by intensifying the highlights in the image. This is done by screening a modified version of the drawable with itself. The modified version is desaturated and then a sigmoidal transfer function is applied to force the distribution of intensities into very small and very large only. This desaturated version is then blurred to give it a fuzzy 'vaseline-on-the-lens' effect. The glow radius parameter controls the sharpness of the glow effect. The brightness parameter controls the degree of intensification applied to image highlights. The sharpness parameter controls how defined or alternatively, diffuse, the glow effect should be."

The sample colors are sorted by brightness (== intentisty) and amount and stored in a sample colortable (where brightness is the index) The pixels of the destination layer are remapped with the help of the sample colortable. If use_subcolors is TRUE, the remapping process uses all sample colors of the corresponding brightness-intensity and distributes the subcolors according to their amount in the sample (If the sample has 5 green, 3 yellow, and 1 red pixel of the  intensity value 105, the destination pixels at intensity value 105 are randomly painted in green, yellow and red in a relation of 5:3:1 If use_subcolors is FALSE only one sample color per intensity is used. (green will be used in this example) The brightness intensity value is transformed at the remapping process according to the levels: out_lo, out_hi, in_lo, in_high and gamma The in_low / in_high levels specify an initial mapping of the intensity. The gamma value determines how intensities are interpolated between the in_lo and in_high levels. A gamma value of 1.0 results in linear interpolation. Higher gamma values results in more high-level intensities Lower gamma values results in more low-level intensities The out_low/out_high levels constrain the resulting intensity index The intensity index is used to pick the corresponding color in the sample colortable. If hold_inten is FALSE the picked color is used 1:1 as resulting remap_color. If hold_inten is TRUE The brightness of the picked color is adjusted back to the origial intensity value (only hue and saturation are taken from the picked sample color) (or to the input level, if orig_inten is set FALSE) Works on both Grayscale and RGB image with/without alpha channel.

If a selection exists and the item is a drawable, the portion of the drawable which lies under the selection is cut from the drawable and made into a floating selection which is then transformed. The transformation is done by scaling the image by the x and y scale factors about the point (source_x, source_y), then rotating around the same point, then translating that point to the new position (dest_x, dest_y). The return value is the ID of the rotated drawable. If there was no selection or the item is not a drawable, this will be equal to the item ID supplied as input. Otherwise, this will be the newly created and transformed drawable.

  "Propagates dark values in an image based on each pixel's relative darkness to a neighboring average. The idea behind this filter is to give the look of a photocopied version of the image, with toner transfered based on the relative darkness of a particular region. This is achieved by darkening areas of the image which are measured to be darker than a neighborhood average and setting other pixels to white. In this way, sufficiently large shifts in intensity are darkened to black. The rate at which they are darkened to black is determined by the second pct_black parameter. The mask_radius parameter controls the size of the pixel neighborhood over which the average intensity is computed and then compared to each pixel in the neighborhood to decide whether or not to darken it to black. Large values for mask_radius result in very thick black areas bordering the regions of white and much less detail for black areas everywhere including inside regions of color. Small values result in less toner overall and more detail everywhere. Small values for the pct_black make the blend from the white regions to the black border lines smoother and the toner regions themselves thinner and less noticable; larger values achieve the opposite effect."

  "This procedure performs a possibly non-affine transformation on the specified item by allowing the corners of the original bounding box to be arbitrarily remapped to any values. The specified item is remapped if no selection exists or it is not a drawable. However, if a selection exists and the item is a drawable, the portion of the drawable which lies under the selection is cut from the drawable and made into a floating selection which is then remapped as specified. The return value is the ID of the remapped item. If there was no selection or the item is not a drawable, this will be equal to the item ID supplied as input. Otherwise, this will be the newly created and remapped drawable. The 4 coordinates specify the new locations of each corner of the original bounding box. By specifying these values, any affine transformation (rotation, scaling, translation) can be affected. Additionally, these values can be specified such that the resulting transformed item will appear to havebeen projected via a perspective transform. This procedure is affected by the following context setters: 'gimp-context-set-interpolation', 'gimp-context-set-transform-direction', 'gimp-context-set-transform-resize', 'gimp-context-set-transform-recursion'."

Higher gamma values result in more high-level intensities. Lower gamma values result in more low-level intensities. The low/high output levels constrain the final intensity mapping--that is, no final intensity will be lower than the low output level and no final intensity will be higher than the high output level. This tool is only valid on RGB color and grayscale images. It will not operate on indexed drawables."

If there is no selection, a seed fill is executed at the specified coordinates and extends outward in keeping with the threshold parameter. If there is a selection in the target image, the threshold, sample merged, x, and y arguments are unused. If the sample_merged parameter is TRUE, the data of the composite image will be used instead of that for the specified drawable. This is equivalent to sampling for colors after merging all visible layers. In the case of merged sampling, the x and y coordinates are relative to the image's origin; otherwise, they are relative to the drawable's origin."

Essentially, the color at the specified coordinates (in the drawable) is measured and the selection expands outwards from that point to any adjacent pixels which are not significantly different (as determined by the threshold and criterion context settings). This process continues until no more expansion is possible. If antialiasing is turned on, the final selection mask will contain intermediate values based on close misses to the threshold bar at pixels along the seed fill boundary. This procedure is affected by the following context setters: 'gimp-context-set-antialias', 'gimp-context-set-feather', 'gimp-context-set-feather-radius', 'gimp-context-set-sample-merged', 'gimp-context-set-sample-criterion', 'gimp-context-set-sample-threshold', 'gimp-context-set-sample-transparent'.

The 'gimp-histogram' function returns statistics based on the pixels in the drawable that fall under this range of values. Mean, standard deviation, median, number of pixels, and percentile are all returned. Additionally, the total count of pixels in the image is returned. Counts of pixels are weighted by any associated alpha values and by the current selection mask. That is, pixels that lie outside an active selection mask will not be counted. Similarly, pixels with transparent alpha values will not be counted."

The idea behind this filter is to give the look of a black felt pen drawing subsequently shaded with color. This is achieved by darkening areas of the image which are measured to be darker than a neighborhood average. In this way, sufficiently large shifts in intensity are darkened to black. The rate at which they are darkened to black is determined by the second pct_black parameter. The mask_radius parameter controls the size of the pixel neighborhood over which the average intensity is computed and then compared to each pixel in the neighborhood to decide whether or not to darken it to black. Large values for mask_radius result in very thick black areas bordering the shaded regions of color and much less detail for black areas everywhere including inside regions of color. Small values result in more subtle pen strokes and detail everywhere. Small values for the pct_black make the blend from the color regions to the black border lines smoother and the lines themselves thinner and less noticable; larger values achieve the opposite effect."

The position argument specifies the location of the layer inside the stack (or the group, if a valid parent was supplied), starting from the top (0) and increasing.
